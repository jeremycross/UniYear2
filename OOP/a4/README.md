# Assignment 4
Utilizing the code from assingment 3 as your backend for dungeon generation create a GUI using JavaFX that will allow a user to generate a random level upon startup and be able to select a specific space (chamber or passage) within the level from a list menu.  
When a space is selected it can be edited by adding/removing specific monsters or treasures to/from that space and a description of that space is visible within the centre text area. When adding treasure/monsters a list of all possible treasures/monsters can be selected from edit pop-up. The level generated/edited should be able to able to be saved using serialization and then loaded later into the program where further editing/inspection can occur.

A pop-up can be shown with information about a specific door in that space.

## Future improvements
The Last assingment in this course was quite a large step up in difficulty from the previous assignments, because of this I would like to pursue adding to this project in my sparetime and make the following improvements to the GUI/Back-end:

Integrate the monster/treasure removal and addition using a data base
CSS formatting to improve the look and feel of the GUI
Spend more time improving the usuability of the editing pop-up
