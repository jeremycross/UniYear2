# Assignment 1
A simple memory system which can track a specified number of blocks of memory and ulilizes a binary file to continuously read/write the information required.
This assignment also includes many array commands such as swapping, inserting, removing, adding, etc. at specific indices that will be used in conjuction
with the memory system to track the reads/writes used for the commands. There is also the same commands for a linked list that is also used in conjunction with the memory system in the same way. This assignment was used to highlight the pros and cons of arrays and linked lists.

Supplementary testing files were also created and used to run tests and produce csv files with the reads/writes from running the tests.
